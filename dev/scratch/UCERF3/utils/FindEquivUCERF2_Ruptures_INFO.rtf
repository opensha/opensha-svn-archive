\f0\fs24 \cf0 This file is a summary of Ned's interpretation of the file "preComputedData/sectEndsForUCERF2_RupsResults_AllButNonCA_B" generated by the method FindEquivUCERF2_Ruptures.findSectionEndsForUCERF2_Rups().\
\
This shows that the only problems in N Cal are sub-seismogenic ruptures being excluded from some sources.  S. Cal sources still have problems in terms of finding section ends for UCERF2 ruptures (eight zero or three found), and that UCERF2 has other fault models in S Cal.\
