These are some files used in developing FM3_SectionsForUCERF2_Sources.txt.

UCERF3_FaultSectAddAndRev_v3_2011_11_15.xlsx (renamed from "UCERF3 2011 Fault Section Additions and Revisions_ver 3_2011_11_15.xlsx") came from Tim via email on 2-17-12.

AllFM3_sectNames.txt came from writing out unique names from:

	FileMakingStuff.writeAllFM3_sectNames();

I then checked whether each UCERF2 fault section listed in (preComputedData/FindEquivUCERF2_Ruptures/FM2_SectionsForUCERF2_Sources.txt, which I obtained using the method FindEquivUCERF2_FM2pt1_Ruptures.getAllSectionNames()) still exist in AllFM3_sectNames.txt, and wrote those that didn't to the first column of the file:

	FM2to3_sectionNameChanges.txt

I then added the second column to this file by hand (using obvious names and Tim's xlsx file above).

After doing the step below I discovered that some sections/sources that were the same between FM 2.1 and 2.2 are now different between FM3.1 and 3.2.  The associated UCERF2 sources are:

	sourceName 	(userf2_sect for both; fm3.1_sect; and fm 3.2_sect)
	----------
	Elsinore;W	(Whittier, alt 2; Whittier alt 1; Whittier alt 2)
	Coronado Bank	(Coronado Bank ; Coronado Bank alt1; Coronado Bank alt2)
	Great Valley 5, Pittsburg Kirby Hills	(Great Valley 5, Pittsburg Kirby Hills; Great Valley 05 Pittsburg - Kirby Hills alt1; Great Valley 05 Pittsburg Kirby Hills alt2)
	Mount Diablo Thrust	(Mount Diablo Thrust; Mount Diablo Thrust North CFM PLUS Mount Diablo Thrust South; Mount Diablo Thrust)
	San Luis Range (So Margin)	(San Luis Range (So Margin); San Luis Range 2011 CFM; San Luis Range (So Margin))
	Zayante-Vergeles	(Zayante-Vergeles; Zayante-Vergeles 2011 CFM; Zayante-Vergeles)

I therefore copied FM2to3_sectionNameChanges.txt into two files 

	FM2to3_1_sectionNameChanges.txt
	FM2to3_2_sectionNameChanges.txt

changed the previous file to old_FM2to3_sectionNameChanges.txt, and made hand edits to these two new files to reflect the above differences.


Finally, I created the files FM3_1_SectionsForUCERF2_Sources.txt and FM3_2_SectionsForUCERF2_Sources.txt by making the substitutions listed in the above FM2to3_?_sectionNameChanges.txt files to the previous FM2_SectionsForUCERF2_Sources.txt using the following code:

	FileMakingStuff.mkNewFilesBySubstitutingNames()

Results for FM3.1:
------------------

The only rupture listed under "Problem Sources (can't find associated inv section for one end of at least one rupture):" is

	Birch Creek

which was removed in going from UCERF2 to UCERF2.

Most of the ruptures listed under "Unassociated UCERF2 ruptures (not from other FM nor subseismogenic, so there should be a mapping?)" have an endpoint this is the only subsection used from its parent section (and we require two subsection from every parent).  The exception are:

	These are still mysterious (they use at least two subsections of each section) - but setting cumAz to 540 will solve (Kevin results imply yes):

	6023	152	549	Death Valley Connected	(Death Valley (Fish Lake Valley), Subsection 6	Death Valley (So), Subsection 5);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	6024	152	550	Death Valley Connected	(Death Valley (Fish Lake Valley), Subsection 5	Death Valley (So), Subsection 4);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	6025	152	551	Death Valley Connected	(Death Valley (Fish Lake Valley), Subsection 4	Death Valley (So), Subsection 3);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	6026	152	552	Death Valley Connected	(Death Valley (Fish Lake Valley), Subsection 3	Death Valley (So), Subsection 2);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	6027	152	553	Death Valley Connected	(Death Valley (Fish Lake Valley), Subsection 2	Death Valley (So), Subsection 2);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	6028	152	554	Death Valley Connected	(Death Valley (Fish Lake Valley), Subsection 2	Death Valley (So), Subsection 1);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	6030	152	556	Death Valley Connected	(Death Valley (Fish Lake Valley), Subsection 10	Death Valley (So), Subsection 1);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false

	These only use one subsection of a parent (in the middle of the parent section due to a Y connection):

	7283	193	3	Landers	(Johnson Valley (No) 2011 rev, Subsection 2	Homestead Valley 2011, Subsection 4);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	7285	193	5	Landers	(Homestead Valley 2011, Subsection 4	Emerson-Copper Mtn 2011, Subsection 8);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	7289	193	9	Landers	(Emerson-Copper Mtn 2011, Subsection 9	Camp Rock 2011, Subsection 1);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	7304	193	24	Landers	(Emerson-Copper Mtn 2011, Subsection 7	Camp Rock 2011, Subsection 1);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	7314	193	34	Landers	(Johnson Valley (No) 2011 rev, Subsection 2	Emerson-Copper Mtn 2011, Subsection 8);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	7326	193	46	Landers	(Johnson Valley (No) 2011 rev, Subsection 1	Emerson-Copper Mtn 2011, Subsection 8);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	7327	193	47	Landers	(Johnson Valley (No) 2011 rev, Subsection 2	Emerson-Copper Mtn 2011, Subsection 9);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	7329	193	49	Landers	(Homestead Valley 2011, Subsection 4	Camp Rock 2011, Subsection 1);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	7348	193	68	Landers	(Johnson Valley (No) 2011 rev, Subsection 1	Camp Rock 2011, Subsection 1);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	7349	193	69	Landers	(Johnson Valley (No) 2011 rev, Subsection 2	Camp Rock 2011, Subsection 2);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	7357	193	77	Landers	(Johnson Valley (No) 2011 rev, Subsection 2	Camp Rock 2011, Subsection 4);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	8685	220	4	Ortigalita	(Ortigalita (North), Subsection 2	Ortigalita (South), Subsection 4);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	8694	220	13	Ortigalita	(Ortigalita (North), Subsection 2	Ortigalita (South), Subsection 5);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	8702	220	21	Ortigalita	(Ortigalita (North), Subsection 2	Ortigalita (South), Subsection 7);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false

	Plus a bunch of "Palos Verdes Connected" ruptures because, in this fault model, "Coronado Bank alt1" 
	no longer connects to "Palos Verdes" (but they should connect in FM 3.2)
