On Nov 3, 2012 I discovered the following error in FM2to3_1_sectionNameChanges.txt and FM2to3_2_sectionNameChanges.txt:

	Green Valley (So)	Green Valley 2011 CFM
	Green Valley (No)	COMBINED

(the first one should say COMBINED as well; I fixed this, and it shouldn't effect anything)

************* Previous notes below:


These are some files used in developing FM3_1_SectionsForUCERF2_Sources.txt & FM3_2_SectionsForUCERF2_Sources.txt.

UCERF3_FaultSectAddAndRev_v3_2011_11_15.xlsx (renamed from "UCERF3 2011 Fault Section Additions and Revisions_ver 3_2011_11_15.xlsx") came from Tim via email on 2-17-12.

AllFM3_sectNames.txt came from writing out unique names from:

	FileMakingStuff.writeAllFM3_sectNames();

I then checked whether each UCERF2 fault section listed in (data/FindEquivUCERF2_Ruptures/FM2_SectionsForUCERF2_Sources.txt, 
which I obtained using the method FindEquivUCERF2_FM2pt1_Ruptures.getAllSectionNames()) still exist in AllFM3_sectNames.txt, and wrote 
those that didn't to the first column of the file:

	FM2to3_sectionNameChanges.txt

I then added the second column to this file by hand (using obvious names and Tim's xlsx file above).

After doing the step below I discovered that some sections/sources that were the same between FM 2.1 and 2.2 are now different between 
FM3.1 and 3.2.  The associated UCERF2 sources are:

	sourceName 	(userf2_sect for both; fm3.1_sect; and fm 3.2_sect)
	----------
	Elsinore;W	(Whittier, alt 2; Whittier alt 1; Whittier alt 2)
	Coronado Bank	(Coronado Bank ; Coronado Bank alt1; Coronado Bank alt2)
	Great Valley 5, Pittsburg Kirby Hills	(Great Valley 5, Pittsburg Kirby Hills; Great Valley 05 Pittsburg - Kirby Hills alt1; Great Valley 05 Pittsburg Kirby Hills alt2)
	Mount Diablo Thrust	(Mount Diablo Thrust; Mount Diablo Thrust North CFM PLUS Mount Diablo Thrust South; Mount Diablo Thrust)
	San Luis Range (So Margin)	(San Luis Range (So Margin); San Luis Range 2011 CFM; San Luis Range (So Margin))
	Zayante-Vergeles	(Zayante-Vergeles; Zayante-Vergeles 2011 CFM; Zayante-Vergeles)
	Fickle Hill	(Fickle Hill; Fickle Hill (alt1); REMOVED)
	Mad River	(Mad River; Mad River (alt1); Mad River - Trinidad fault zone (alt2))
	McKinleyville	(McKinleyville ; McKinleyville (alt1); REMOVED)
	Trinidad	(Trinidad ; Trinidad (alt1); REMOVED)

I therefore copied FM2to3_sectionNameChanges.txt into two files 

	FM2to3_1_sectionNameChanges.txt
	FM2to3_2_sectionNameChanges.txt

changed the previous file to old_FM2to3_sectionNameChanges.txt, and made hand edits to these two new files to reflect the above differences.


Finally, I created the files FM3_1_SectionsForUCERF2_Sources.txt and FM3_2_SectionsForUCERF2_Sources.txt by making the substitutions listed 
in the above FM2to3_?_sectionNameChanges.txt files to the previous FM2_SectionsForUCERF2_Sources.txt using the following code:

	FileMakingStuff.mkNewFilesBySubstitutingNames()
	
Following our preliminary model (and before the final model), two additional fault section name changes were made:

	"Landers 2011 rev" changed to "Kickapoo"
	"Oceanic 2011 CFM" changed to "Oceanic - West Huasna"
	
I update the FM3_1_SectionsForUCERF2_Sources.txt and FM3_2_SectionsForUCERF2_Sources.txt files accordingly 
(only the first one exists in these files), but I did not redo all the above (meaning the files in this 
directory are out of date).  I updated FM2to3_?sectionNameChanges.txt with the above name changes on 9/20/12.

Results for FM3.1:
------------------

The only source listed under "Problem Sources (can't find associated inv section for one end of at least one rupture):" is

	Birch Creek

which was removed in going from UCERF2 to UCERF3 FM 3.1.

Most of the ruptures listed under "Unassociated UCERF2 ruptures (not from other FM nor subseismogenic, so there should be a mapping?)" 
have an endpoint this is the only subsection used from its parent section (and we require two subsection from every parent).  
The exception are:

	These only use one subsection of a parent (in the middle of the parent section due to a Y connection):

	7283	193	3	Landers	(Johnson Valley (No) 2011 rev, Subsection 2	Homestead Valley 2011, Subsection 4);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	7285	193	5	Landers	(Homestead Valley 2011, Subsection 4	Emerson-Copper Mtn 2011, Subsection 8);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	7289	193	9	Landers	(Emerson-Copper Mtn 2011, Subsection 9	Camp Rock 2011, Subsection 1);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	7304	193	24	Landers	(Emerson-Copper Mtn 2011, Subsection 7	Camp Rock 2011, Subsection 1);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	7314	193	34	Landers	(Johnson Valley (No) 2011 rev, Subsection 2	Emerson-Copper Mtn 2011, Subsection 8);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	7326	193	46	Landers	(Johnson Valley (No) 2011 rev, Subsection 1	Emerson-Copper Mtn 2011, Subsection 8);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	7327	193	47	Landers	(Johnson Valley (No) 2011 rev, Subsection 2	Emerson-Copper Mtn 2011, Subsection 9);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	7329	193	49	Landers	(Homestead Valley 2011, Subsection 4	Camp Rock 2011, Subsection 1);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	7348	193	68	Landers	(Johnson Valley (No) 2011 rev, Subsection 1	Camp Rock 2011, Subsection 1);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	7349	193	69	Landers	(Johnson Valley (No) 2011 rev, Subsection 2	Camp Rock 2011, Subsection 2);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	7357	193	77	Landers	(Johnson Valley (No) 2011 rev, Subsection 2	Camp Rock 2011, Subsection 4);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	8685	220	4	Ortigalita	(Ortigalita (North), Subsection 2	Ortigalita (South), Subsection 4);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	8694	220	13	Ortigalita	(Ortigalita (North), Subsection 2	Ortigalita (South), Subsection 5);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false
	8702	220	21	Ortigalita	(Ortigalita (North), Subsection 2	Ortigalita (South), Subsection 7);  onlyOneSubsectOfSect = false

	Plus a bunch of "Palos Verdes Connected" ruptures because, in this fault model, "Coronado Bank alt1" 
	no longer connects to "Palos Verdes" (but they should connect in FM 3.2).


Results for FM3.2:
------------------

Same as for several above.

The only sources listed under "Problem Sources (can't find associated inv section for one end of at least one rupture):" are

	Birch Creek
	Fickle Hill
	McKinleyville
	Trinidad

which were removed in going from UCERF2 to UCERF3 FM 3.2.

The following are problems not already identified for FM 3.1 above:

"Oak Ridge Connected" are filtered out because "Oak Ridge (Offshore)" is too far from "Oak Ridge (Onshore)"
