**************** SHORT TERM (HIGH PRIORITY): ****************
-------------------------------------------------------------


For the SCEC-ITR CME:
---------------------

Implement retrieval of Primary Key in DAO Insert metdhods as a JDBC Transaction.

CVS Cleanup
  Make CMEDB module accessible on SunOne Module List by
    - backup up directory
    - export files
    - using CVS command line interface
         add module to repository
         import CMEDB file

Create a SCEC-URI generator function.

Create User Main Screen that says"
  "Create Resource"
  "View Resource"
  "Status of Resource"

Construct "Create Resource" Input Pages
  - Create "Construct Gridded Region" Page.
  - Create "Construct IMR" Page.
  - Create "Construct ERM" Page.

Create Server Version of HazardMapCalculator that accepts as inputs
   String URL's to "resources" only, and URI to ResourceInstanceID.
   - Write JUnit test to show this version of HazardMapCalculator runs.

Create WebService Interface to this HazardMapCalculator program.
  - Use One-Way RPC to implement non-blocking calls to the HazardMapCalculator Program.
  - Talk with Deepak about deploying this service. He has made good progress on Web Service
     deployment.

GMT_MapGenerator - implement this as a webService so we one doesn't need GMT installed (also implement as a web service and compare performance). NOTE: this is already implemented as a servlet.

SHA ProjectTestSuite : 24 Tests

For OpenSHA:
------------

Make apps that use internet connection graceful if it's not available.


AttenRelApp:

	Problem:  choose BJF97, set Mag=8, and hit add trace, at prompt asking whether to accept
		  the non-recommended mag, hit yes.  Note that the plot is not added until one
		  pushes add trace again.

	Old problem: when you've violated an absolute constrain by hitting return 
			(rather than hitting "Add Trace"), subsequent warning constraint violations 
			are not handled properly.  Example:  Choose BJF, set Mag=8 and add trace 
			(after accepting violation), now set Vs30=-10 and hit return (not add trace),
			now set Mag=8.1 and try to add (it defaults back to previous value).

Get wg99/02 Fortran code compiling on our computers.



**************** LONG TERM (LOWER PRIORITY): ****************
-------------------------------------------------------------

Go through existing apps and list issues we'd like to improve.


IMR_GuiBean 	-extend to allow multiple IMRs to be selected, with relative weights 
		applied to each.  This will require using an epistemic list control 
		panel (generalize existing one?) to declare what to compute and 
		plot(ind. curves, mean, fractile, ...). 

		-Create capability to associate IMRs to specific source types in the calculations
		(this will take some thought).

		- For IMR_API, create a getOtherParameters() method and use this
		 here rather then getting the stdDevType, TruncType, ... by hand
		(this will make if more flexibly with new IMRs that don't have
		those parameters).  This will require implementing that method
		in the existing attenuation relationships (will require a little
		work since the otherParamsList contains one param that won't
		be needed).

ProbEqkSource	Define field to declare what type of source it is 
		(e.g., subduction zone vs normal vs reverse ...) and add to API. 
		Ned will work on what the various options should be.

ERF		-extend API to include getting max and min magnitude, and the various types of 
		sources generated (to check for compatibility with each chosen IMR)

Think about optimizing calculations in terms of not redoing anything that doesn't 
need to be redone (e.g., don't recompute ERF-list hazard curves if user only wants
to plot a different fractile).  This should be resolved with consideration to the
full range of user experiences.


ScenarioShakeMapApp

	Add plotting of rupture surface as a dot at each point on the gridded surface?
	Use getInfo for each source to provide users with information

Fix titles of web pages (Ned's problem)

Fix GriddedFaultApplet - horz/vert scaling.

Finish implementing WG99/02 ERF (Ned's problem)

Ned - Run a forecast with non-zero mags up to mag 10 to search for numerical breakdowns (e.g., Math.pow(-num, non-integer) ) or search for for Math.pow.


SimpleGriddedFaultFactory

	we create a new instance of this object every time we create 
	a new surface; it would be more efficient to use the set methods
	before getting a new surface (use the setAll() method added by Ned).


(even lower priority below)



Allow choosing of multiple ERFs (e.g., hand built ERF_EpistemicList)

Create the following control panels in the future:

	X_ValuesInCurveControlPanel

Create SimpleFaultParameter and editor (so we can replace two PEER ERFs with one general ERF)

Implement getApplicableRegion() and isLocWithinApplicableRegion() methods in implemented ERFs.

Investigate what proper longitude limits are with respect to RelativeLocation, 0 to 360, -180 to 180, -180 to 360, or -360 to 360.

DisaggregationCalculator is similar to HazardCurveCalculator; should the two be combined?

HazardCurveApplet - In the IMT editor section the loop over independent parameters of the chosen IMT can presently deal only with DoubleDiscreteParameter objects (rather than any parameter type).  Should we generalize this?

HazardCurveApplet - Ned will go through our implementation of the PEER test cases again (to make sure Ned didn't screw anything up since he last did it).  Perhaps this should wait until we can simultaneously show the true or target value in the plot.  Eventually we'll want to make Junit tests for the PEER test cases.

EvenlyGriddedSurface: 1) make the getNthSubsetSurface() method more efficient, and have the getAveDip() method compute the dip explicitly (in case it's a subset of a listric fault)?

Decide how to handle rake=NaN in each IMR (can rake-NaN in and EarthquakeRupture object?).

Decide on and implement a licensing agreement.

Decide on and implement email groups.

Figure out why applets don't resize with browser window size on Mac OS.

Create an archived email list or discussion board for OpenSHA.

Add 3D visualization to GriddedFaultApplet (need Java3D on Mac OS first)?

Go over exception throwing in entire package to make sure it looks appropriate.
