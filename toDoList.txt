   **************** SHORT TERM (HIGH PRIORITY): ****************
-------------------------------------------------------------

Change the faultParameterEditor as follows:

	If StirlingGriddedFaultFactory model is chosen, add another adjustable parameter to the list:

		DoubleParameter(name="Ave. Dip Direction", units="degrees", min=0, max=360 default=Math.NaN)


	then set this value using the setAveDipDir(method) of the StirlingGriddedFaultFactory 
	after setting everything else but before getting the surface.


Re-calculate the PEER set2, case5 (including fractiles) and update the Excel spreadsheet (I changed the implementation and I believe it is now correct).

AttenuationRelationshipApp

	Remove the label (and space) at the top where is says "Attenuation Relationship GUI"
	(this is redundant with the application title bar)

	Fix this plotting problem: Choose ShakeMap (2003), select "Std. Dev." for the Y axis, and 
	then add plot (you can't see anything, presumably because the data only has one value).  This
	is only a problem for linear plots, which means it my be JFreeChart's issue?


GMT_MapGenerator:

	Figure out a way to get the following dynamically (can only do this on UNIX?):

   		GMT_PATH
    		GS_PATH
    		CONVERT_PATH

Look into how to save an application in its current state (and to an abitrary file name) so that a user can double click later to come back.

We need to somehow metadata in the HazardCurveCalculator; also make the ability to "peel off" the plot/metadata window (Ned and Nitin will discuss this more later)?

Finish PEER results plotter & data submission tool (when they give us the final files).

Make all interpolations of hazard curves based on log(prob) vs log(IML) or log(EqvPoisRate) vs log(IML).  Do this by adding a method to DiscretizedFunctionAPI (e.g., getInterpolatedY_inLogXLogYDomain(double x). Ned needs to double check these.

Find a database we can reference for lat/lon values of cities in California.  Add some of these to the control panel.  Nitin has one.

Investigate what proper longitude limits are with respect to RelativeLocation, 0 to 360, -180 to 180, -180 to 360, or -360 to 360.

*****************************************************************

HazardSpectrumApplet - Look into making it so the ERF_GuiBean and EqkRupSelectorGuiBean use the same ERF instances (in cases where both have the same ERF, although sometime on or the other might have an ERF that the other one does not)?  This will take some thought because the present implementation of the GuiBeans are a subclass of ParameterEditor which leads to even worse memory problems for the first attempted solution.  Solve this once we have a better idea of exactly what Caltrans wants.  Perhaps we should merge the two GuiBeans into one?

Ned - implement the empty-constructor version of the  WG02_EqkRupForecast (1 realization with modal values, handle timespan correctly, and delete WG02_WRAPPER_INPUT.DAT file when done.

Ned needs to think about the following:

	Subduction Interface
	Subduction IntraSlab
	Shallow Crustal in Active Tectonic Regions
	Shallow Crustal in Stable Tectonic Regions

Implement 2002 National Hazard maps model - Ned will work on.

Fix GriddedFaultApplet - horz/vert scaling - may be fixed; check it out; add java 3D

Make J-unit tests for Campbells tests of the attenuation relationships (generalize as much as possible); shakemap tests well come from Ken later.  ned should look at.  Nitin says there are still important discrepancies.

Finish STEP map making capability according to feedback from Matt and Lucy (and solve the Vs30 on water issue).

SimpleListricGriddedFaultFactory has problem - run main method to find it.  Ned will look at this.

Explore the benefit of using RelativeLocation.getApproxHorzDistance(*) as opposed to RelativeLocation.getHorzDistance(*) in the hazard calculations.

Should we create an AjustableParametersAPI for all objects that have a list of adjustable parameters?

**************** LONG TERM (LOWER PRIORITY): ****************
-------------------------------------------------------------

IMR_GuiBean 	-extend to allow multiple IMRs to be selected, with relative weights 
		applied to each.  This will require using an epistemic list control 
		panel (generalize existing one?) to declare what to compute and 
		plot(ind. curves, mean, fractile, ...). 

		-Create capability to associate IMRs to specific source types in the calculations
		(this will take some thought).

ProbEqkSource	Define field to declare what type of source it is 
		(e.g., subduction zone vs normal vs reverse ...) and add to API. 
		Ned will work on what the various options should be.

ERF		-extend API to include getting max and min magnitude, and the various types of 
		sources generated (to check for compatibility with each chosen IMR)

Ned - Run a forecast with non-zero mags up to mag 10 to search for numerical breakdowns (e.g., Math.pow(-num, non-integer) ) or search for for Math.pow.

SimpleGriddedFaultFactory

	we create a new instance of this object every time we create 
	a new surface; it would be more efficient to use the set methods
	before getting a new surface (use the setAll() method added by Ned).

EvenlyGriddedSurface: have the getAveDip() method compute the dip explicitly (in case it's a subset of a listric fault)?

(even lower priority below)

Allow choosing of multiple ERFs (e.g., hand built ERF_EpistemicList)

Implement getApplicableRegion() and isLocWithinApplicableRegion() methods in implemented ERFs.

DisaggregationCalculator is similar to HazardCurveCalculator; should the two be combined?

HazardCurveApplet - In the IMT editor section the loop over independent parameters of the chosen IMT can presently deal only with DoubleDiscreteParameter objects (rather than any parameter type).  Should we generalize this?

Decide how to handle rake=NaN in each IMR (can rake-NaN in an EarthquakeRupture object?).

Decide on and implement a licensing agreement.

Decide on and implement email groups.

Figure out why applets don't resize with browser window size on Mac OS.

Create an archived email list or discussion board for OpenSHA.

Add 3D visualization to GriddedFaultApplet (need Java3D on Mac OS first)?

Go over exception throwing in entire package to make sure it looks appropriate.

AttenRelApp:

	Problem:  if you violate a parameter constraint when hitting the add trace button 
	(rather than hitting return in the parameter editor) you need to hit add trace again
	if you accept the value.  Nitin and Vipin say this is a problem with Java (focus at
	time of exception throwing is lost).
