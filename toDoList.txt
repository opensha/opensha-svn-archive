    **************** SHORT TERM (HIGH PRIORITY): ****************
-------------------------------------------------------------

Ned needs to check SRL Paper2 figure calcs after fixing small bug in WG02_CharEqkSource (should the figs be updated)?

Ned also needs to document WG02_EqkRupForecast (Java docs).

AttenautionRelationshipApp:

	Black Background checkbox doesn't work - remove if fix is non trivial

	X & Y axis labels are reversed

	Show data does not have any data shown.

	One can't plot more than one curve

	If you plot a line for SA, then change to symbols (click Apply), and
	then go to plot PGA, it will use a line with a size of 4 (rather than 1).

	Look for other bugs.

	Add a button that allows user to add custom data points (and an info-metadata
	string to show in the legend).  The default plotting of these is set as symbols
	(if possible). Keep that last set of entries in the popup window for convenience 
	(e.g., for when plot was erased by switching from PGA to SA)

Change app names as follows (on our web site too):

	HazardDataSetPlotter --> PlotCurveFromHazardDataSetApp
	HazardMapApplet --> HazardDataSetCalcCondorApp
	HazardMapViewerApp --> PlotMapFromHazardDataSetApp

EarthquakeRuptureGuiBean:

	update "Set Params for Puente Hills Scenario" (validate against old)

	make version of above that uses the EqkRup (not ERF) & validate

	make sure metadata is good

	remove the "Create Rupture" button, and create rupture when "Make Map"
	button is pushed or "Set Hypocenter" is checked; automically un-check latter
	(& make null) if faultParameter or lat/lon/depth values change.  Don't
	recreate rupture if it's still fresh

combine TimeSpanGuiBean with ERF_GuiBean & validate.  Make sure the timeSpan elements are distinguishable from the ERF adjustable parameters.

Add ability to add custom, observed data points to the AttenuationRelationshipApp.  Ned will explain how when ready.

Implement color schemes at (including option for the visually impaired):

	http://geography.uoregon.edu/datagraphics/color_scales.htm

Add faults to GMT plotting options.

In all apps - can we have a bug-reporting via email utility?

add site translation for SEA_1999_AttenRel

Set up registration for HazMapDataGenerator - Phil has good ideas about this.

Get JBuilder-2005.

Make sure that averages over probabilities are not log averages (Nitin will change ScenarioShakeMapCalculator & Ned will change USGS_Combined Atten. Rel. accordingly).

Do we really all the API's in org.scec.sha.earthquake package  or can we just use the Abstract classes rather then defining these API's. Also have to take care that we these classes are not used in RMI based interfaces.

In the case of our HazardCurve Calculator applications, if ERF List is choosen and we select 1 or more realizations and average is selected, then it throws an exception. --Nitin knows about this problems and will look into it.

Nitin has to add the some more functionality to the Remote_ERFClients ( some functions needs to be added). Once that is done and have tested the application to a good extent then swap it with the HazardCurverServerModeApp .

Prepare a brief documentation on the how and why I did HazardCurveServer Mode in RMI. This will also include preparing a brief documentation on RMI and webservices. This document should also include the possible flaws in the applications and what improvements are needed in the application and what's more needs to be added to generalize the application.

Work on the data file provided by NGA to get the Observed EqkRuptures from them and create the HazardCurve for these ruptures.

Create a CVS setup document that anyone can download from our website. It should also includes the libraries
that the person needs to include and classes that needs to be compiled as RMI.

HazardCurveApps:

	1) 1 version where everything is on the user's computer.

	2) another version where everything (ERFs and calcs) are distributed.  This app is an extension of that above.
	   IMRs will remain on local machine for now (until we need otherwise).

Implement point source correction option in PropagationEffect.

GMT_MapGenerator:

	If gmt in not in /sw/bin or nothing is in usr/scec/data/gmt - force use of GMT Web Service (Nitin)

The Log Plot tester App does not work for the Linear Scale.

Make email lists for the following (with on-line archives):

	users@OpenSHA.org
	developers@OpenSHA.org
	leaders@OpenSHA.org
	advisors@OpenSHA.org

Work on following papers:

	Hazus for Puente Hills

	So. Cal. Hazard maps using GRID (and other approaches)

	Announce applications available?

Figure out how to add the OpenSHA logo to shakeMaps.

Go over exception throwing in entire package to make sure it looks appropriate.

Standardize source definition with pathway 2?

Get e-access to SCEC 2005 Consensus Geologic Fault Parameters.

Peter Powers' stress chance calculator (and Jeremy's work)?

Formally test all applications before publication (this will take planning).

Write user's manuals for applications.

Create capability to associate IMRs to specific source types in the calculations (this will take some thought and perhaps some communication with Golden).  Ned's intitial tests on adding such fields to EqkRupture does not significantly increase memory requirements.  Possibilities:

	Subduction Interface
	Subduction IntraSlab
	Shallow Crustal in Active Tectonic Regions
	Shallow Crustal in Stable Tectonic Regions

Make a library to represent t-surfaces (or look on internet to see if someone else has come up with a good object-oriented design).

Get our GriddedSurface object plottable in LA3D (so EqkRupture surfaces can be plotted).

Re-calculate the PEER set2, case5 (including fractiles) and update the Excel spreadsheet (I changed the implementation and I believe it is now correct).

Look into how to save an application in its current state (and to an abitrary file name) so that a user can double click later to come back.

Finish PEER results plotter & data submission tool (when they give us the final files).

Find a database we can reference for lat/lon values of cities in California.  Add some of these to the control panel.  Nitin has one.  Make a web service?

Investigate what proper longitude limits are with respect to RelativeLocation, 0 to 360, -180 to 180, -180 to 360, or -360 to 360.

Solve Our MetaData Issues.  We need to be able to do three things: 1) inform the user what they are looking at in a plot (this is done); 2) save the state of a stand-alone app on the user's computer so they can relaunch later and begin where they left off; and 3) save enough information to the SRB (or equivalent) so we can tell at runtime whether a calculation has already been done, or so other's browsing the SRB will see what's available. This raises issues with respect to allowed characters in a parameter name.  Why don't we reserve the following special characters for writing the string-representation of metadata (meaning these can't be used in parameter names):

	=	- separate name/value pairs
	;	- to separate parameters
	[	- to encapsulate dependent params
	]	- to encapsulate dependent params
	:	- for writing out parameterList (or GuiBean) values (also "----" under these?)

	Check for these in the setName() methods?

	Can we avoid such special character issues using XML representation (for the case where
	we read values back in to redo a calculation)?

	With respect to GuiBeans we have discussed two approaches.  Let's take the ERF_GuiBean as
	an example.  One mode (mentioned above) is to read back in the parameter settings (from XML),
	set the parameter values accordingly, and then recreate the ERF.  If the ERF is very time
	consuming to create, then the second mode would be to read back in the serialized version
	of the object, and since all the parameter are already set, the GuiBean would not have to
	do anything.  Note that all non primitive parameter types (e.g., MagFreqDistParam and
	SimpleFaultParam) must contain all info needed by their respective editor to recreate the
	object; this info is stored in their dependent parameter list.


HazardSpectrumApplet - Look into making it so the ERF_GuiBean and EqkRupSelectorGuiBean use the same ERF instances (in cases where both have the same ERF, although sometime on or the other might have an ERF that the other one does not)?  This will take some thought because the present implementation of the GuiBeans are a subclass of ParameterEditor which leads to even worse memory problems for the first attempted solution.  Solve this once we have a better idea of exactly what Caltrans wants.  Perhaps we should merge the two GuiBeans into one?

Fix GriddedFaultApplet - horz/vert scaling - may be fixed; check it out; add java 3D.  Or should we use LA 3D?

Finish STEP map making capability according to feedback from Matt and Lucy (and solve the Vs30 on water issue).

SimpleListricGriddedFaultFactory has problem - run main method to find it.  Ned will look at this.

Should we create an AjustableParametersAPI for all objects that have a list of adjustable parameters?

**************** LONG TERM (LOWER PRIORITY): ****************
-------------------------------------------------------------

Implement NGA relationships when ready.

ProbEqkSource	Define field to declare what type of source it is
		(e.g., subduction zone vs normal vs reverse ...) and add to API.
		Ned will work on what the various options should be.

ERF		-extend API to include getting max and min magnitude, and the various types of
		sources generated (to check for compatibility with each chosen IMR)

Ned - Run a forecast with non-zero mags up to mag 10 to search for numerical breakdowns (e.g., Math.pow(-num, non-integer) ) or search for for Math.pow.

EvenlyGriddedSurface: have the getAveDip() method compute the dip explicitly (in case it's a subset of a listric fault)?

(even lower priority below)

Allow choosing of multiple ERFs (e.g., hand built ERF_EpistemicList)

Implement getApplicableRegion() and isLocWithinApplicableRegion() methods in implemented ERFs.

DisaggregationCalculator is similar to HazardCurveCalculator; should the two be combined?

IMT_GuiBean - the loop over independent parameters of the chosen IMT can presently deal only with DoubleDiscreteParameter objects (rather than any parameter type).  Should we generalize this?

Decide how to handle rake=NaN in each IMR (can rake-NaN in an EarthquakeRupture object?).

Decide on and implement a licensing agreement.

Figure out why applets don't resize with browser window size on Mac OS.

Vector PSHA?

Pathway 1.5?

AttenRelApp:

	Problem:  if you violate a parameter constraint when hitting the add trace button
	(rather than hitting return in the parameter editor) you need to hit add trace again
	if you accept the value.  Nitin and Vipin say this is a problem with Java (focus at
	time of exception throwing is lost).

JFreechart problem: If the the upperBound and lowerBound of the axis are the same then JFreechart only adds a small increment to axis range, so because of this in our AttenuationRelaitonshipApp when we choose the BJF attenRel and on Y-Axis choose the Std. Dev. we get same values for all X-values. In other words, our lowerBound and upperBound are the same. JFrechart does provide a method to handle and specify minimum range between the Upperbound and LowerBound of the axis but we can't just add a number to specify the range.
