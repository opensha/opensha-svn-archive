 To increase memory, here are the steps:

	   and then "Run.....". A window will pop up.

To update the OpenSHA jar file in the SCEC VDO project

	Run 'ant/CompleteJar.xml' as an ant build. This will create the file, 
	'dist/OpenSHA_complete.jar'. This then needs to be moved to 
	scec_vdo_new/lib/opensha.jar. Then refresh your SCEC-VDO project, and run it.

	It's best to not commit the updated jar files to SCEC-VDO unless an update is 
	necessary for everyone, as they are stored in binary in the repository and 
	cause its size to grow very quickly.

To have SCEC VDO access the OpenSHA project rather than the jar file:

	* Go to the properties for the SCEC-VDO project (right click -> Properties)
	* Select the "Libraries" tab.
	* Select "opensha.jar" and hit "Remove"
	* Select the "Projects" tab.
	* Hit "add" then select the OpenSHA project
	* Hit "OK" in all dialogs.
