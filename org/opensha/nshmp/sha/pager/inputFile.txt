#
# Choose an INTENSITY_MEASURE TYPE ("PGA", "PGV", "SA", and "MMI"
# are currently supported).  If "SA" is chosen give the period as 
# well (e.g., "SA 1.0") the code will throw and exception (show 
# an error message" if the chosen intensity-measure type is not 
# supported by the chosen attenuation relationship (the html
# documentation for each above gives those that are supported)
MMI
#
# Choose whether to plot LEVEL AT PROB ("0") or PROB AT LEVEL ("1")
# The second number is the value (prob for "0" or level for "1");
# e.g. "0  0.5" will plot the level that has an exceedance probability
# of 0.5 (the median), and "1 1.0" will plot the probability of exceeding
# 1 G (if the IMT is PGA or SA).  Note that "0  0.50" is the only option 
# supported for MMI because no one has told us how to compute sigma.
0  0.5
#
# POINT SOURCE CORRECTION? - "0" for no correction or "1" for
# a median correction (no sigma correction is yet available).  
# This assumes a straight, vertically dipping rectangular 
# fault with any possible strike and any hypocentral location.

# The DEFAULT SITE TYPE that will be used anywhere outside

B
#
# Tell whether you want a SIMPLE GMT MAP generated (which will
# pop up in a window) - "1" for yes and "0" for no
