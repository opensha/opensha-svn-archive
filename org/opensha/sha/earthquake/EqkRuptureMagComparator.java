  /**
   * Compares its two arguments for order. Returns a negative integer, zero, or
   * a positive integer as the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second.
   * The implementor must ensure that sgn(compare(x, y)) == -sgn(compare(y, x))
   * for all x and y. (This implies that compare(x, y) must throw an exception if
   * and only if compare(y, x) throws an exception.)
   * The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive:
   * ((compare(x, y)>0) && (compare(y, z)>0)) implies compare(x, z)>0.
   * Finally, the implementer must ensure that compare(x, y)==0 implies that
   * sgn(compare(x, z))==sgn(compare(y, z)) for all z.
   * It is generally the case, but not strictly required that
   * (compare(x, y)==0) == (x.equals(y)). Generally speaking, any
   * comparator that violates this condition should clearly indicate this fact.
   * The recommended language is "Note: this comparator imposes orderings that
   * are inconsistent with equals."
