The file Frankel96_CAL_all.txt represents all 3 of Frankel's original fault input files for California condensed into one file.  See the "PreviousVersions" directory/folder for details on how this was done.

The elements of this file are as follows.

For each fault source:

	1st Line:

		faultClass		(either "A" or "B")
		faultingStyle	("SS", "R", or "N") 
		faultName

	2nd Line:

		charMag
		charRate

	3rd Line:

		dip			(may be negative!)
		downDipWidth
		depthToTop

	4th Line:

		numFaultTraceLocs

	Last lines (total of numFaultTraceLocs lines):

	lat[i], lon[i]		(fault-trace points)


NOTES:  

1) It would be better to list the actual rake rather than "SS", "R", and "N", but I didn't have time to hand edit whether "SS" was rake=0 or rake=180.

2) It would be better (more physical; less model dependent) to list the momentRate rather than charRate.

The California background seismicity-rates file (CAagrid.asc, which is self explanatory) was obtained from:
