This is what I did to get ascii rate files here

	cp ../*/binaryAgrid/* ../*/mmax/* .

	ls *.txt | sed -e 'INFO/d' > junk1

		(need to filter more *.txt files in the above now)

	awk '{print "java Bin2Ascii4Floats",$1}' <junk1> shscr1

	chmod a+x shscr1

	shscr1

	awk '{print "rm",$1}' <junk1> junk2
	chmod a+x junk2
	junk2

	rm junk?

The "LonsLats.txt" file comes from an ascii file "agrid_cstcal.txt" that came from Golden at some point.

"RELM_RegionLatsLons.txt" I made from org.opensha.data.region.EvenlyGriddedRELM_Region

I then edited a header into each file.

	paste LonsLats.txt agrd_[bcd]* > temp1
	paste agrd_[mw]* > temp2
	paste area* mojave* port* sangreg* >temp3
	paste temp1 temp2 >temp4
	paste temp4 temp3 >all_data.txt

	paste fltmmaxCA2ch.out7.txt.asc fltmmaxCA2gr.out7.txt.asc > mmax_data.txt

The IgorAnalysis file generates eps plots of each source.

Looks like the ones I need for CA (i.e., inside the RELM region) are:

	agrd_brawly.out.txt.asc
	agrd_mendos.out.txt.asc

		The above use b=0.8, Mmin=5, and Mmax=7

	agrd_creeps.out.txt.asc

		The above uses b=0.9, Mmin=5, and Mmax=6

	agrd_cstcal.out.txt.asc

		The above has 1/3 reduction above M 6.5, and 50/50 wt
		on the mMax files: fltmmaxCA2ch.out7.txt & fltmmaxCA2gr.out7.txt.

	agrd_deeps.out.txt.asc

		The above uses b=0.9, Mmin=5, and Mmax=7.2

	agrd_wuscmp.out.txt.asc (same as agrd_wuscmp_nopuget.out.txt.asc in CA)

		The above has default of b=0.8, Mmin=5, and Mmax=7, but uses the 
		following Mmax files w/ 50/50 wt: fltmmaxALLCNch.outv3 & fltmmaxALLCNgr.outv3
		(These mmax files not yet avail, so use default for now)

	agrd_wusext.out.txt.asc

		The above has default of b=0.8, Mmin=5, and Mmax=7, but uses the 
		following Mmax files w/ 50/50 wt: fltmmaxALLCNch.outv3 & fltmmaxALLCNgr.outv3
		This may also have a 1/3 reduction above M 6.5 (they're considering this)
		(These mmax files not yet avail, so use default for now)


	area1new.agrid.txt.asc
	area2new.agrid.txt.asc
	area3new.agrid.txt.asc
	area4new.agrid.txt.asc
	mojave.agrid.txt.asc
	sangreg.agrid.txt.asc

		The above use b=0.8, Mmin=6.5, and Mmax=7.6
