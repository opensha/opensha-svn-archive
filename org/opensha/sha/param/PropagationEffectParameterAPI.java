/**
* <p>Title: PropagationEffectParameterAPI</p>
* <p>Description: Interface that PropagationEffect
* Parameters must implement. </p>
*
* Propagation Effect Parameters are a specific subclass
* of parameters that deal with earthquake probability
* variables. Their defining characteristics are that
* they take two independent variables, a Site and ProbEqkRupture
* and then can calculate their own value. Their use is distinct
* from regular parameters in that setValue() is typically
* not called. That is the only way to set standard
* parameters. <p>
*
* This API defines several gatValue() functions that take
* different combinations of Site and ProbEqkRupture that
* will make this parameter recalculate itself, returning the
* new value. <p>
