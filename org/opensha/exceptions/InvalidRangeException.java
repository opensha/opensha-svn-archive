 *  <b>Title:</b> InvalidRangeException<p>
 *  <b>Description:</b> Exception thrown when trying to set a value outside an
 *  axis range.<p>
 *
 * Note: These exception subclasses add no new functionality. It's really
 * the class name that is the important information. The name indicates what
 * type of error it is and helps to pinpoint where the error could have occured
 * in the code. It it much easier to see different exception types than have one
 * catchall RuntimeException type.<p>
