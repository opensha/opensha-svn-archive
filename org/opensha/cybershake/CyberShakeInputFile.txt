# Choose an INTENSITY_MEASURE TYPE ("PGA", "PGV", "SA", and "MMI"
# are currently supported).  If "SA" is chosen give the period as 
# well (e.g., "SA 1.0") the code will throw and exception (show 
# an error message" if the chosen intensity-measure type is not 
# supported by the chosen attenuation relationship (the html
# documentation for each above gives those that are supported)
