The base_mod_23_wgt_n100.OpenSHA.*yr.txt files were made by Ned by running the Neds.shscr (located here) in the wg99_src_v27 directory (the one on Ned's computer, but it should do the same thing elsewhere).

These files allow the time span to be adjusted in our non-fortran-wrapper ERF.


The file

	singleIterationWithModes.OpenSHA.30yr.txt

was also created by Neds.shscr.  This is a single-iteration run for 30 years where the modes at each branch tip are given unit weight (and all others are zero).  This file is used by the no-argument constructor for the WG02_EqkRupForecast, and this is used by the scenarioShakeMapApp (we only want one iteration in this app so it might as well use the model values).
