These input files came from the directory:

	PSHA/Frankel_2002_Stuff/InputFilesForOpenSHA

on Ned Field's computer (these were originally sent from Cao of the CGS, and everything up through the attenuation relationship stuff was cut from the beginning of each file).  Some other minor changes were made as noted in the above directory.  Some extra blank lines at the end of some of the files also had to be removed.

Only fault files are included so far (used in haxFXv3 and haxFXv3a)

The elements of each fault file are as follows.

For each fault source:

	1st Line:  

		fault_grid_spacing_km
		floater_offset_km

	Lines 2-4:

		num_epistemic_mag_uncert_vals
		increments (in units of mag)
		wts

	Line 5:

		aleatory_uncert_stddev
		truncation level (units of stddev)

	6th Line:

		faultClass		(either "A" or "B")
		faultingStyle	("SS", "R", or "N") 
		faultName

	7th Line:

		charMag
		charRate

	8th Line:

		dip			(may be negative!)
		downDipWidth
		depthToTop

	9th Line:

		numFaultTraceLocs

	Last lines (total of numFaultTraceLocs lines):

	lat[i], lon[i]		(fault-trace points)


NOTES:  

1) It would be better to list the actual rake rather than "SS", "R", and "N", but I didn't have time to hand edit whether "SS" was rake=0 or rake=180.

2) It would be better (more physical; less model dependent) to list the momentRate rather than charRate.
