These files were e-mailed to us by Ken Campbell, and are used to verify our implementations
of the NGAs against his.

Each line contains values describing a given rupture, and the PGA, PGV, and SA values for it.
We test each NGA with those settings for each rupture to verify that the OpenSHA values match
those from Ken to within 0.5 %.
