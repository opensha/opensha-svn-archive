/**
 * <b>Title:</b> TestLocation<p>
 *
 * <b>Description:>/b> JUnit tester for the Location object. Tests every
 * piece of functionality, included expected fail conditions. If any
 * part of the test fails, the error code is indicated. Useful to ensure
 * the accuracy and weither the class is functioning as expect. Any
 * time in the future if the internal code is changed, this class will
 * verify that the class still works as prescribed. This is called
 * unit testing in software engineering. <p>
 *
 * Note: Requires the JUnit classes to run<p>
 * Note: This class is not needed in production, only for testing.<p>
 *
 * JUnit has gained many supporters, specifically used in ANT which is a java
 * based tool that performs the same function as the make command in unix. ANT
 * is developed under Apache.<p>
 *
 * Any function that begins with test will be executed by JUnit<p>
