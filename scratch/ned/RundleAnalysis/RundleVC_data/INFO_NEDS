This contains info on Rundle's VC data (from http://hirsute.cse.ucdavis.edu/~rundle/VC_FILES/FOR_NED/), and my analysis thereof.


The *.pro files are for some analysis program he uses.

VC_FAULTS_2001v6.d - is his input file specifying fault sections

	Note:  All segments are vertically dipping rectangles.  
	Coordinate system is x-axis east, y-axis north.  
	Coordinates are in km with respect to origin at 
	31 degrees N Lattitude, 121 degrees W Longitude
	Col 1    Depth to bottom of segment (all of them are 15 km)	Col 2    Depth to top of segment (all of them are 0 km)	Col 3    x-coord of west end of segment	Col 4    y-coord of west end of segment	Col 5    x-coord of east end of segment	Col 6    y-coord of east end of segment	Col 7    long term rate of slip of segement in cm/yr.  
		(+ sign = right lateral.  - sign = left lateral).	Col 8    a meaningless number

	I made a version with a "txt" rather than "d" extension for ease of reading into apps.

VC_Fault_Activity_SAF.d	

	the original fault activity file.  In this file, the
	physics of fault failure involves a dynamic stress triggering
	mechanism (DynStr=.6) that operates only on the San Andreas fault.
	Originates from files VC_2001v8_14q.d to VC_2001v8_17q.d

VC_Fault_Activity_ALLF.d

	which is a new file where the physics of fault failure involves 
	the same dynamic stress triggering mechanism, but this time
	it operates on all faults.  Originates from files VC_2001v8_13j.d
	to VC_2001v8_16j.d  

I created faultNames-Segments.txt from Table 1 in the paper.  This contains the fault name and index of the first and last segment.

All other files (e.g., VC_faultNamesNumPts.txt & VC_faultTraces.txt) were made from my Java code or from the Igor analysis.

The *Rand* files were cases where event times were randomized (which took a bit of hacking of the Java code because years went from ints to doubles).

	Note: I think there may be a problem here because "VC_segRandNumYearSlip.txt" 
	does not seem compatible with the other files.

John told me that events at the beginning are safe to use.

I'm still not sure how to interpret the creeping section (see his July 27th, 2005 email).
