// Input file for ERF logic tree definition. 

// A logic tree is defined by a series of branching levels (each identified by the keyword "BranchingLevel"). 
// Each branching level is defined by:
// - a integer number: (identifying the position of the level in the logic tree)
//-  a string: (describing what type of uncertainties the branching level is representing),
//-  one or more integer numbers: indexes of previously defined branches to which
//  the current branching level is applying to. 
// For this last entry, there are two special cases: the string "NONE" represents the case in which
// the branching level does not apply to anything (this is only used for the first branching level), 
// and the string "ALL" indicating that the branching level applies to all previously created branches 

// A branching level is then populated by one or more branches. A set of branches is defined by the keyword
// "BranchSet".
// A "BranchSet" is defined by an uncertainty model type (specifying how the uncertainty model is defined). Currently
// there are two ways to specify an uncertainty model:
//         - inputfile: ASCII input file defining a source model
//         - rule: predefined string defining a single parameter uncertainty model
// If "inputfile" is chosen then the user must provide one or more input file names (including paths)
// together with descriptor strings and associated weights. 
// If "rule" is chosen then the user must provide a rule descriptor string (among the ones that the software can process)
// and one or more parameter uncertainties values, together with the associated weights.
