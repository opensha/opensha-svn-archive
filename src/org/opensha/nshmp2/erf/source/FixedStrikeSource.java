/**
 * This is a custom Fixed-Strike Source (Point-Source variant) representation
 * used for the NSHMP. It was derived from the UCERF2
 * {@code Point2Vert_FaultPoisSource} and was initially created to provide built in approximations of distance and
 * hanging wall effects as well as to override getMinDistance to provide
 * consistency with distances determined during hazard calcs.
 * 
 * THis is kind of kludgy for now. In NSHMP calcs, we're not concered with dip
 * for fixed strike sources. THis is due to the fact that in the CEUS, gridded
 * finite faults are always strike slip, and in the West with NGA's, dip is
 * handled by reading the rupture rake to
 * 
 * TODO the eclosed ruptures can be much simpler than Frankel gridded surfaces
 * we're going to try settin gupper and lower seis depth to dtor
