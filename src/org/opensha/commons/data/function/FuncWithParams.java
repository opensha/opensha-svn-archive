 * implement this interface. This interface is for Functions that contain
 * parameter lists. These lists are currently used for storing the parameter
 * name and values that went into constructing the list, such as for an IMR
 * exceedence probability.<p>
 *
 * This interface was developed to be used by DiscretizedFuncAPI subclasses.
 * Of course any class that constains a ParameterList can implement this.<p>
