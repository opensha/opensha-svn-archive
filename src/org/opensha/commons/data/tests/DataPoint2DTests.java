/**
 * <b>Title:</b> DataPoint2DTestCase<p>
 *
 * <b>Description:</b> Class used by the JUnit testing harness to test the
 * DataPoint2D. This class was used to test using JUnit. For some reason
 * testEquals() fails in JUnit, but the main() test (hand coded testing) shows
 * that the DataPoint2D passes the tests. Need more exploring of JUnit. <P>
 *
 * Note: Requires the JUnit classes to run<p>
 * Note: This class is not needed in production, only for testing.<p>
 *
 * JUnit has gained many supporters, specifically used in ANT which is a java
 * based tool that performs the same function as the make command in unix. ANT
 * is developed under Apache.<p>
 *
 * Any function that begins with test will be executed by JUnit<p>
