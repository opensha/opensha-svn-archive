/**
 *  <b>Title:</b> EmpiricalDistributionTreeMap <p>
 *
 * <b>Description:</b> This class is similar to DataPoint2DTreeMap,
 * except that rather than replacing a point that has the same x value (or within
 * tolerance, which is required to be zero here), the y values are added together.
 * This is useful for making an empirical distribution where the y-values represent
 * the frequency of occurrence of each x value.  In this context, a nonzero tolerance
 * would not make sense because a values might fall into different points depending
 * on what order they're added.  Due to the numerical precision of floating point
 * arithmetic, the tolerance is really about 1e-16. <P>
 *
 * I'm not sure that allowing difference comparators (other than the default)
 * makes any sense.<P>
 *
 * See documentation for EmpiricalDistributionTreeMap for more info
