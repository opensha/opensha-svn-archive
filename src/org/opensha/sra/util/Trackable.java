/**
 * This interface specifies the minimum set of functions required for a class to
 * implement to be considered "trackable".  The interface was developed specifically
 * for the Residential Risk application developed under the OpenRisk effort, however
 * it should be general enough to be used in other applications.
 * 
 * The Trackable interface allows for developer-defined depenencies between classes.
 * As was initially intended for OpenRisk software, we have two basic classes, a 
 * VulnerabilityModel, and a StructureType.  These classes exist in a many to many
 * relationship, and this interface allows them to be aware of which counterparts
 * are currently available for a given class.
 * 
 * While in principle the implementing class can be concrete, this interface is most
 * useful when the implementing class is abstract and multiple subclasses have varying
 * interdependencies.
